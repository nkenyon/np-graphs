Demonstrate 2 data series displayed with Google Charts - Line Chart, data read from file, no parameters passed in the calling URL or between html and php

Files:

1 Dual_001.csv    Simple extension of log file structure - timestamp,sensor1,sensor2 - contains 4 records

2 Nget2data.php   Defines values for the 2 sensors - expects no parameters to be passed.
                  The data file name is pre-defined - Dual_001.csv
                  Extends the column definitions in the echo command - by example.
                  Extends the data structure in the echo command following the explode - by example.
                  
3 N2Graph.html    Expects NO Parameters in the calling URL.
                  Calls Nget2data.php with NO parameters.
                  Differs further from Nico's original sensorgraph.html in that more options in the final display are defined.
                  
Making this work with parameter passing is another exercise for the near future.
